_Create ANKI flashcards from text files of poems_

* In the desktop Anki, click 'Deck' to take you to the list of decks, then click 'Import'

* Pick the file you just generated and make sure that the type is set to 'Text file separated by tabs or semicolons' and open it.

* Click on the 'Deck' button to choose the deck to which they should be added, or to create a new one.

* When that's done, check that Anqi has detected that the fields are separated by tabs, and click import.

* For best effect, read the lines out loud to yourself when studying the cards.  Spoken words are much more memorable than read ones.
